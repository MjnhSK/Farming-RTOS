# Farming-RTOS
An RTOS simulation code of a certain farming procedure

In this project, there are 8 files:
- main.c and main.h: the main files running the simulated LEDs system.
- scheduler.c and scheduler.h: the cooperative scheduler code.
- software_timer.c and software_timer.h: the timer code.
- Farming.ioc: the config of the STM32 103C6

We also include images of our simulation and state machine diagram for insight in our report.
